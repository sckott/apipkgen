Generate a HTTP API wrapper package from a yaml template for the API


#### Abandoned/Archived

This package has been abandoned/archived. I no longer have time/interest to work on this. It's too complicated of a problem to be easy enough to do in the very few hours I have to work on open source projects not related to work. And REST APIs - even Open API/Swagger ones - are so varied that maintaining a tool for them I think would be a lot of work. 

Maybe try out <https://github.com/bergant/rapiclient>
