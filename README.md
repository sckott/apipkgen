[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

Generate a HTTP API wrapper package from a yaml template for the API

The internals are a little hacky, but the point is to have as few dependencies as possible, just depending on `yaml` right now.

### Steps

* Specify API in a YAML file
* Run `apipkgen::generate_pkg()` to generate a package
* Write wrapper functions in the new package
* Done!

### Features

* Package generation from a yaml template
* gives back raw text right now, will add toggles to add JSON vs. XML parsers
* specify query parameters, including options, whether required or not, and expected class
* same as previous, but for paths on the base URL

### Example spec

* nytimes <https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs> (requires auth)
* stripe <https://github.com/stripe/openapi> (requires auth)
* Canada's BC government <https://github.com/bcgov/api-specs> (auth not required)

## Install


``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("sckott/apipkgen")
```


``` r
library("apipkgen")
```

## Simple yml template (not fitting swagger/etc.)

### generate a package

use the function `generate_pkg()`


``` r
template <- system.file("examples", "template_crossref.yml",
  package = "apipkgen"
)
path <- file.path(tempdir(), "crpkg")
generate_pkg(path, template_path = template)
```

### your package needs functions

The package created doesn't have any exported functions, just internal functions for your to build user facing functions.

Let's write a user facing functions. The Crossref API template above specified for the `works` route that parameters are `query` and `rows`. So let's work with those.


``` r
crossref_works <- function(query = NULL, rows = NULL, ...) {
  crpkg::works(query = query, rows = rows, ...)
}
```

In addition, it's a good idea to always allow users to pass in curl options. Beginners can ignore it, but power curl users will want/have to play with curl options. The function builder builds in `...` as a parameter so in the user facing function above all you have to do is add that as well for users to access.

### Install package

Go to the new directory, and in R/RStudio run `devtools::document()` and `devtools::install()` (or equivalent).

### Use package

Call the function. The package builder gives back plain text, so you have to parse it yourself.


``` r
res <- crossref_works(query = "science")
jsonlite::fromJSON(res)
#> $status
#> [1] "ok"
#>
#> $`message-type`
#> [1] "work-list"
#>
#> $`message-version`
#> [1] "1.0.0"
#>
#> $message
#> $message$query
#> $message$query$`search-terms`
#> [1] "science"
#>
#> $message$query$`start-index`
#> [1] 0
#>
#>
#> $message$`items-per-page`
#> [1] 20
#>
#> $message$items
#>     indexed.date-parts    indexed.date-time indexed.timestamp reference-count
#> 1        2015, 12, 27 2015-12-27T23:37:50Z      1.451259e+12               0
#> 2        2015, 12, 24 2015-12-24T22:03:23Z      1.450995e+12               0
#> 3        2015, 12, 25 2015-12-25T19:17:30Z      1.451071e+12               0
#> 4        2015, 12, 27 2015-12-27T19:35:51Z      1.451245e+12               0
```

## Swagger/OpenAPI


### Example 1

Get a spec, in this case from the Province of British Columbia <https://github.com/bcgov/api-specs>


``` r
bc_spec <-
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcgov/api-specs/master/bcgnws/bcgnws.json"
bc_spec_path <- "bcgov_bcgnws.yaml"
download.file(bc_spec, bc_spec_path)
```

Generate the package, and install it


``` r
generate_pkg(
  pkg_path = "bcgov/",
  template_path = bc_spec_path
)
devtools::document("bcgov")
devtools::install_local("bcgov", force = TRUE, quiet = TRUE)
```

Restart R ...

Get man page for a function


``` r
?bcgov::nameAuthorities
```

Run some functions


``` r
bcgov::nameAuthorities()
```


``` r
res <- bcgov::names_search(name = "Victoria")
tibble::as_tibble(jsonlite::fromJSON(res)$features)
```

cleanup


``` r
unlink("bcgov", TRUE, TRUE)
unlink(bc_spec_path, TRUE)
remove.packages("bcgov")
```

### Example 2

An example with the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/)


``` r
doaj_spec <- "https://doaj.org/api/v1/swagger.json"
doaj_spec_path <- "doaj.json"
download.file(doaj_spec, doaj_spec_path)
```

Generate the package, and install it


``` r
generate_pkg(
  pkg_path = "doaj/",
  template_path = doaj_spec_path,
  base_url = "https://doaj.org"
)
devtools::document("doaj")
devtools::install_local("doaj", force = TRUE, quiet = TRUE)
```

Run a function


``` r
doaj::api_v1_search_journals_search_query("cellular")
```

cleanup


``` r
unlink("doaj", TRUE, TRUE)
unlink(doaj_spec_path, TRUE)
remove.packages("doaj")
```
